# Anton Smolyanyy

Hi, I’m currently a third year Data Science and Applied Math student at the **University of Utah**. 

Last summer I interned in the Bay Area as a **DevRel Engineer** at **Descope**, an exciting startup with $53M in seed funding. I worked to enhance developer experiences in the Auth/CIAM space through sample apps, MCP integrations, technical blogs, and documentation.

At the University of Utah, in addition to my classes I am working at the [Integrated Multi-Physics Lab](https://newell.mech.utah.edu/) under [Dr. Pania Newell](https://www.mech.utah.edu/directory/faculty/pania-newell/). There I worked on project in the field of computational mechanics, building machine learning workflows with Python, DOLFINx, and Gmsh. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me on the speed climbing wall, preparing for my next competition as part of the US National Team.
